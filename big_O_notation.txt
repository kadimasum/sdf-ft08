BIG O Notation
--------------

Measure time complexity and space complexity

Time complexity
---------------
Constant time = O(1)
Liniear time = O(n) [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Logarithmic time = O(log n) = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Exponential time = O(n2)
O(n log n)




Space Complexity
-------------------------
Constant space = O(1)
Liner space = O(n)
Logarithmic space  = O(log n) = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Exponential space = O(n2)
O(n log n)
